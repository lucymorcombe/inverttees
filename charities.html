        <div class="indvAbout"><p>Palestine Children's Relief Fund (PCRF), founded in 1991 by concerned humanitarians in the USA, provides free medical care to thousands of injured and ill children yearly who lack local access to care within the local health care system.  <br><br>
            Over the years, they've sent over 2,000 affected children abroad for free medical care, sent thousands of international doctors and nurses to provide tens of thousands of children free medical care in local hospitals, and provided tens of thousands of children humanitarian aid and support they otherwise would not get.   <br><br>
            PCRF's impact also includes establishing two paediatric cancer departments in Palestine, a new PICU and paediatric cardiology department in Ramallah, and many more critical projects to sustainably bolster the region's healthcare system. Their foundation relies on grassroots efforts, supported by a worldwide network of thousands of volunteers, to fulfil their humanitarian mission. <br><br>
            PCRF envisions a world where all children in the Middle East have access to quality medical care, regardless of nationality, religious or political affiliation, and specialized health services for children are independent and developed at the highest standards.

        <div class="indvAbout"><p>Refuge is the largest specialist domestic abuse organisation in the UK. On any given day our services support thousands of survivors, helping them to overcome the physical, emotional, financial and logistical impacts of abuse and rebuild their lives — free from fear. <br><br>
            They opened the world’s first safe house for women and children in 1971. <br><br>
            “It was in Chiswick, West London. Women and children escaping domestic abuse flocked to our doors because, for the first time, someone was saying it was wrong to beat your partner. Back then, domestic abuse was seen as a “private matter”, to be dealt with behind closed doors. Society turned a blind eye.” <br><br>
            Since 1971, Refuge has led the campaign against domestic abuse. They’ve grown to become the country’s largest single provider of specialist domestic and gender-based violence services, offering many different services <br><br>
            <strong>Help with housing</strong><br>
            For those fleeing an abusive partner, with or without children, our refuges provide emergency temporary accommodation with specialist staff on hand to offer one-to-one support. <br><br>
            <strong>Legal help</strong><br>
            Our independent domestic violence advocates (IDVA) address the safety of survivors at risk of harm from intimate partners, ex-partners, or family members to secure their safety and the safety of their children. This can include supporting victims by demystifying the criminal justice system, and advocating on their behalf with other – often statutory – agencies. <br><br>
            <strong>Help with money</strong><br>
            We help survivors take steps to regain their financial independence and begin to rebuild their life, free from fear. <br><br>
            <strong>Protecting children</strong><br>
            We provide refuge accommodation and expert emotional support for children fleeing domestic abuse with their mothers, as well as guidance for women on how to secure their children’s safety. <br><br>
            <strong>Government benefits</strong><br>
            We help women fleeing domestic abuse navigate the welfare benefits provided by the government, including special rules to support survivors. <br><br>
            <strong>Domestic abuse services</strong><br>
            We offer a range of specialist, confidential services that support survivors whether they have left their partner or not — including refuge accommodation, community outreach support, independent advocacy, culturally-specific services, and support for children. <br><br>
            <strong>Help with tech abuse</strong><br>
            We help survivors who’ve had tech used against them as a weapon of domestic abuse to secure their technology and take back control of their lives. We have the only dedicated, expert tech abuse team in the UK. <br><br>
            <strong>Support for young people</strong><br>
            We support young people in the community experiencing or at risk of domestic abuse, by working to increase their long-term safety and preventing future abuse through early intervention.

        <div class="indvAbout"><p>Terrence Higgins Trust is the UK’s leading HIV and sexual health charity, and one of the largest in Europe. <br><br>
            The charity is named after Terry Higgins who was one of the first people to die of an AIDS-related illness in 1982. Founded by his partner and friends, they hoped to personalise and humanise AIDS in a very public way. They set up THT with the intention of preventing others from having to suffer as Terry had. They were the first charity in the UK to be set up in response to the HIV epidemic and have been at the forefront of the fight against HIV and AIDS ever since. <br><br>
            They have always supported men who have sex with men, haemophiliacs, sex workers and drug users equally. And now with around half as many African people living in the UK diagnosed with HIV as gay and bisexual men, the charity is always evolving to support anyone who needs it. Existing services have been developed and new services introduced to meet ever-changing needs. <br><br>
